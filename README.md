# Design Patterns
Designs patterns in C#

Singleton - Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access and thread safety

Decorator - Attaches responsibility to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. In other words it uses composition and limiting inheritance to simplify object relationships, making them easier to update or manage.
